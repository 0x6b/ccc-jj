Generate a Conventional Commit message in {language} for the following diff.

Conventional Commits Format:
<type>: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]

Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, style, perf, build, ci

Guidelines:
- Title: 50 characters max, imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
    - Do NOT include scope or component in parentheses
    - Prioritize: feat > fix > refactor > others
    - If multiple types, choose the most significant one
- Body: 72 characters per line max, explain WHAT and WHY (not how)
    - Include body only if explanation adds value beyond the title
    - Use bullet points for multiple changes or breaking changes
    - For breaking changes, explain migration path in footer with "BREAKING CHANGE:" prefix

OUTPUT ONLY THE COMMIT MESSAGE. NO EXPLANATIONS, NO COMMENTARY, NO MARKDOWN CODE BLOCKS.
